This skeleton is adapted from a variety of base projects and demos found across the web.

Some basic features are included as a starting point, but should be expanded/adapted/removed depending on the particular application:
	Basic user auth (could be more secure)
	Basic DB interaction
	Basic Templating and Wrapper examples
	Basic css and wrapper adapter from the HTML5 boilerplate project

Change the value of 'cookie_secret' in web.py by running this in python for each app:
	import base64
	import uuid
	base64.b64encode(uuid.uuid4().bytes + uuid.uuid4().bytes)

requires:
	python 2.6 or 2.7
	tornado
