Rename "skeleton" dir to something more project specific, also change any references to skeleton to this new name.
The directory structure is not fixed; you can make it basically whatever you want, just change imports accordingly.

Also change the value of 'cookie_secret' in web.py by running this in python for each app:
	import base64
	import uuid
	base64.b64encode(uuid.uuid4().bytes + uuid.uuid4().bytes)

requires:
	python 2.6 or 2.7
	tornado
